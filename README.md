The main purpose of this web application is to recommend various tourist attractions and places to visit, as well as hotels, restaurants and guides based on the user’s city of reference.
The web application also offers the user the possibility to create, plan, review trips. Every trip can be added to the user’s favourite list and can be shared with other users. 

Main Functionalities:
