# TripPlanner

Stelian Fedorca / Getejanc Marin

The main purpose of this web application is to recommend various tourist attractions and places to visit, as well as hotels, restaurants and guides based on the user’s city of reference.
The web application also offers the user the possibility to create, plan, review trips. Every trip can be added to the user’s favourite list and can be shared with other users. 

Main Functionalities:
The user enters the website and will be prompted to create an account / log in (facebook, google, twitter).
On the first page of the app, the user can search for any city he wants to visit, along with the start and end date.
The user will be redirected to another page with multiple tabs:
The first tab shows the places to visit depending on the city that was chosen.For every place we have a picture, a description, reviews and the option to add to favourites list.
The second tab ‘Where to Stay’ is for finding hotels in that area. The user will be redirected to specific sites to find the places to stay.
The third tab ‘Where to Eat’ contains popular restaurants and places to eat.
In the fourth tab the user can view and be inspired by others users’ favourites list.
